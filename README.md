# Skylab Freight

Skylab Freight is an intense single player quake map designed in the trenchbroom editor. The setting of the map is a Sci-Fi warehouse, taking inspiration from space stations and sci-fi media. Download and play the map using your own Quake compiler or check out the [walkthrough] page on the wiki!
